# Output files for testing the package

This folder contains data created with the model. The templates were modificated 
to create outputs for different model options:

- nyear_spinup 250
- iffire 0
- npatch 5
- patcharea 500
- estinterval 5
- ifdisturb 0
- distinterval 50 



The model was run directly without using the package.

The files are used to compare them against outputs created with model when using 
the package for the same options.
